/**
  * Balanced Academic Curriculum Problem
  * The BACP is to design a balanced academic curriculum by assigning periods to courses in a way that
  * the academic load of each period is balanced, i.e., as similar as possible . The curriculum must obey the following administrative and academic regulations:
  * Academic curriculum: an academic curriculum is defined by a set of courses and a set of prerequisite relationships among them.
  * Number of periods: courses must be assigned within a maximum number of academic periods.
  * Academic load: each course has associated a number of credits or units that represent the academic effort required to successfully follow it.
  * Prerequisites: some courses can have other courses as prerequisites.
  * Minimum academic load: a minimum amount of academic credits per period is required to consider a student as full time.
  * Maximum academic load: a maximum amount of academic credits per period is allowed in order to avoid overload.
  * Minimum number of courses: a minimum number of courses per period is required to consider a student as full time.
  * Maximum number of courses: a maximum number of courses per period is allowed in order to avoid overload.
  * The goal is to assign a period to every course in a way that
  * - the minimum and maximum academic load for each period,
  * - the minimum and maximum number of courses for each period,
  * - and the prerequisite relationships are satisfied.
  * An optimal balanced curriculum balances academic load for all periods.
